# 🧩 DSA-Playground
A comprehensive collection of **Data Structures & Algorithms** problems solved in **Java**, organized by topic and difficulty.  
This repository showcases clean Java code, detailed explanations, and algorithmic problem-solving skills—perfect for SDE interviews and competitive programming.

## 📌 Features
- **Topic-wise Structure**: Arrays, Strings, Linked Lists, Trees, Graphs, Dynamic Programming, and more.
- **Well-Documented Solutions**: Each file contains the **problem statement**, **approach**, and **time/space complexity**.
- **Multiple Approaches**: Brute-force and optimized solutions where relevant.
- **Unit Tests & CI**: JUnit tests with GitHub Actions for automated checks.
- **Progress Tracker**: `progress.md` to monitor daily problem-solving.
